Data Structures & Algorithms Toolbox
====================================

The Data Structures & Algorithms Toolbox provides advanced data
structures and algorithms for the MATLAB(r) environment. It implements
functions to create and destroy singly and doubly linked list, stack,
queue, binary tree and red-black (balanced) binary tree. Data elements
can be inserted, deleted or searched for. A graphical representation of
trees can be shown. All algorithms are clearly written as m-files, which
allows the toolbox to be used as a teaching aid in educational data
structures courses. This is the first implementation available of
advanced datatypes, common in other languages, for MATLAB.


Features

o Freeware. The toolbox is available for free download.

o Singly and doubly linked list, stack and queue.
  Allocate, free, insert, search, delete.

o Binary tree, red-black (balanced) binary and AVL tree:
  Allocate, free, insert, search, delete, traverse.

o Visualization of tree structures.

o Clear, readable algorithms in m-functions. Modifications
  of the algorithms or creation of new datatypes are possible.

o Flexiblilty: data structures can contain any Matlab data,
  including cell arrays and other structures.

o Using the most efficient datatype for the task. A binary tree
  or linked list is many times more appropriate than an array.

The Data Structures & Algorithms Toolbox is initially available for
MATLAB 5 and MATLAB 6 on Windows 95,98,ME,NT,2000 systems.
