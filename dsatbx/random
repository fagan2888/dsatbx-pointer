it
Era
of
computers
was
easy
to
Golden
separate
the
men
from
the
boys
sometimes
called
Real
Men
and
Quiche
Eaters
in
the
literature
During
this
period
the
Real
Men
were
the
ones
that
understood
computer
programming
and
the
Quiche
Eaters
were
the
ones
that
real
computer
programmer
said
things
like
DO
10
I1
10
and
ABEND
they
actually
talked
in
capital
letters
you
understand
and
the
rest
of
the
world
said
things
like
computers
are
too
complicated
for
me
and
I
can't
relate
to
computers
they'
re
so
impersonal
A
previous
points
out
that
Real
Men
don't
relate
to
anything
and
aren't
afraid
of
being
impersonal
But
as
usual
times
change
We
are
faced
today
with
a
world
in
which
little
old
ladies
can
get
computers
in
their
microwave
ovens
12
year
old
kids
can
blow
Real
Men
out
of
the
water
playing
Asteroids
and
PacMan
and
anyone
can
buy
and
even
understand
their
very
own
Personal
Computer
The
Real
Programmer
is
in
danger
of
becoming
extinct
of
being
replaced
by
highschool
students
with
TRASH80s
There
is
a
clear
need
to
point
out
the
differences
between
the
typical
highschool
junior
PacMan
player
and
a
Real
Programmer
If
this
difference
is
made
clear
it
will
give
these
kids
something
to
aspire
to
a
role
model
a
Father
Figure
It
will
also
help
explain
to
the
employers
of
Real
Programmers
why
it
would
be
a
mistake
to
replace
the
Real
Programmers
on
their
staff
with
12
year
old
PacMan
players
at
a
considerable
salary
savings
LANGUAGES
The
easiest
way
to
tell
a
Real
Programmer
from
the
crowd
is
by
the
programming
language
he
or
she
uses
Real
Programmers
use
FORTRAN
Quiche
Eaters
use
PASCAL
Nicklaus
Wirth
the
designer
of
PASCAL
gave
a
talk
once
at
which
he
was
asked
How
do
you
pronounce
your
name?
He
replied
You
can
either
call
me
by
name
pronouncing
it
Veert
or
call
me
by
value
Worth
One
can
tell
immediately
from
this
comment
that
Nicklaus
Wirth
is
a
Quiche
Eater
The
only
parameter
passing
mechanism
endorsed
by
Real
Programmers
is
as
implemented
in
the
IBM/370
FORTRAN
G
and
H
compilers
Real
programmers
don't
need
all
these
abstract
concepts
to
get
their
jobs
done
they
are
perfectly
happy
with
a
keypunch
a
FORTRAN
IV
compiler
and
a
beer
Real
Programmers
do
List
Processing
in
FORTRAN
Real
Programmers
do
String
Manipulation
in
FORTRAN
Real
Programmers
do
Accounting
if
they
do
it
at
all
in

Real
Programmers

Artificial

programs

If
you
can't
do
it
in
FORTRAN
do
it
in

language
If
you
can't
do
it
in

language
it
isn't
worth
doing
STRUCTURED
PROGRAMMING
The
academics
in
computer
science
have
gotten
into
the
structured
programming
rut
over
the
past
several
years
They
claim
that
programs
are
more
easily
understood
if
the
programmer
uses
some
special
language
constructs
and
techniques
They
don't
all
agree
on
exactly
which
constructs
of
course
and
the
examples
they
use
to
show
their
particular
point
of
view
invariably
fit
on
a
single
page
of
some
obscure
journal
or
another
clearly
not
enough
of
an
example
to
convince
anyone
When
I
got
out
of
school
I
thought
I
was
the
best
programmer
in
the
world
I
could
write
an
unbeatable
tictactoe
program
use
five
different
computer
languages
and
create
1000
line
programs
that
WORKED
Really!
Then
I
got
out
into
the
Real
World
My
first
task
in
the
Real
World
was
to
read
and
understand
a
200000
line
FORTRAN
program
then
speed
it
up
by
a
factor
of
two
Any
Real
Programmer
will
tell
you
that
all
the
Structured
Coding
in
the
world
won't
help
you
solve
a
problem
like
that
it
takes
actual
talent
Some
quick
observations
on
Real
Programmers
and
Structured
Programming:
Real
Programmers
aren't
afraid
to
use
GOTOs
Real
Programmers
can
write
five
page
long
DO
loops
without
Real
Programmers
like
Arithmetic
IF
statements
they
make
the
code
more
interesting
Real
Programmers
write
selfmodifying
code
especially
if
they
